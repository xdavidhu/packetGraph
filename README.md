## Usage

To scan the traffic you can either use a standard WiFi interface or an ESP8266!

**Install the requirements**

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install tshark python3-pip -y`

`sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

**WiFi interface (e.g. USB dongle)**  

Start monitor mode on your WiFi card: `airmon-ng start <interface>`  
Example: `airmon-ng start wlan0`  

Make sure your card supports monitor mode!

**ESP8266**  

Flash the esp8266_packet_counter onto your ESP8266. You can either use the Arduino sketch or the .bin file.  
Then just plug the ESP8266 in over USB.  

**Start the program**

`sudo python3 packetGraph.py`
